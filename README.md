# S&F Profitability Calculator

This simple tool allows you to enter data from the quests you have to choose from, and will let you know how much gold you can get from each.

The simple calculation formula is `(gold + item_worth) / thirst_cost`. The result is how much gold you'll make relative to the thirst spent.
